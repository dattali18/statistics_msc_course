# Task 1 – Statistical Data Mining Project

## Step 1: Building a Database

You must propose a **population** to be statistically analyzed.
For those who find it difficult to choose, the following suggestions may help:

* Find **at least 101 different objects** (preferably around 136 if possible).
* Collect data from **multiple sources** (e.g., from class, online, etc.).
* The population will be analyzed based on various variables and characteristics.

### Example Populations

* Snack bags: crackers, pretzels, Bissli, Bamba, Cheetos, etc.
* Fruits: grapes, plums, apricots, apples, etc. (you may analyze just the pits if you wish).
* 1 kg of walnuts (shelled or unshelled), dried figs or apricots.
* Game balls or toy parts – uniform yet varied items.
* Bags of gummy candies or hard candies.

> You may suggest your own population idea.
> You must get **teacher approval** for your chosen population before starting the project.

## Step 2: Variables to Analyze

The chosen population should be measured and analyzed based on different variables, such as:

* Weight, height, length, width, color
* Nominal categorical variables (e.g., color of wrapping, symmetry, “beauty”)
* Ordinal or qualitative variables with an appropriate coding system: good, almost good, not good

---

## Step 3: Data Entry

All collected data and observations should be entered into an **Excel file**.

---

## Step 4: Basic Statistical Analysis

Perform initial statistical analyses where relevant, including:

* Mean, variance, standard deviation, median
* Mean absolute deviation
* Range, midrange, percentage of errors, and relevant proportions

---

## Step 5: Frequency Analysis

Create **frequency tables** including:

* Frequency, relative frequency, cumulative frequency
* Class boundaries (real and imaginary), class width
* Median, interquartile range, and relevant percentiles (e.g., 0.1, 0.9)

---

## Step 6: Graphical Representation

Present the data visually using graphs such as:

* Bar charts or histograms
* Pie charts
* Frequency polygons

---

## Step 7: Advanced Analysis

Choose **three variables** and **specific objects**, and compute their **standard scores (Z-scores)**.

---

### Additional Notes

* The project can be completed **individually or in pairs (recommended)**.
* You must obtain **teacher approval** for your dataset and chosen variables before starting.
